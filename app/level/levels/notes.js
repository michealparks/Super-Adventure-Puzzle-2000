-- Question --

Have you ever been introduced to the fundamental physical laws of
our universe?

- Yes

Well then. You're quite educated for someone of your... level of income.
I'm sure you'll still appreciate a refresher.

- Yes, No

As you would expect to hear, we live in a frictionless universe where one,
thank Descartes, may travel limitlessly until smashing violently against a
surface of some sort. No doubt you've spent much of your waste... er...
colorful childhood exploring this phenomenon.

- Yes, No

...

...that wasn't a yes or no question.

This may be harder than I thought.

So, it may be... less likely that you have also witnessed the other of our most
fundamental set of laws. From Descartes himself:

"A stationary body,
when struck by a body in motion --
given this moving body is constituted of pure evil --
will instantaneously explode in an
awesome fireball from which no matter remains.

The body in motion will explode in the fireball as well.""

I will find that the fundamental physical laws of this universe
are

Hello there! And welcome to a world that makes very little sense!

My name is Professor. People call me Doctor Professor...

because I have a PhD.

Doubtless you have learned by now that this world is inhabited by
creatures call morons.

-------------------------------------

With my brains and your, er, willingness to mercilessly
slaughter anyone without thought, we're practically unstoppable!

What do you say Bip?

--------------------------------------

There is a structure--a temple--that very few know about, and even
fewer dare utter it's name...

mostly because it's only mentioned in academic journals.

It's called the Rhomicuboctohedron, and it's where we will find God.

Well... in the way Einstein meant it.

At least that's what conjecture supports.

Anyway. We're going there. To check it out.

...

Just be grateful we don't have to go to the Rhombicosidodecahedron. Oh man is that a bad place!
